## Project Description

This project uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The model is based on the BERT architecture.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- transformers
- torch
- numpy

You can install these libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To use the sentiment analysis model, run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script with your text input as a command-line argument:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py "Your text here"
```

The script will return a sentiment score. A negative score indicates negative sentiment, a score around zero indicates neutral sentiment, and a positive score indicates positive sentiment.

You can also adjust the model's confidence threshold and save the model's predictions to a file using the command-line options.

## Model

The model is a BERT model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. It is saved in the `model` directory.
